/** Query 7:
From the weather table, fetch all the records when London had 
extremely cold temperature for 3 consecutive days or more.

Note: Weather is considered to be extremely cold then its temperature 
      is less than zero.

Approach:
      First using a sub query identify all the records where the temperature was very cold
      and then use a main query to fetch only the records returned as very cold from the sub query.
      You will not only need to compare the records following the current row but also need to compare the records 
      preceding the current row. And may also need to compare rows preceding and following the current row.
      Identify a window function which can do this comparison pretty easily.
